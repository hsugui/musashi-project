# Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Simulation
This repository contains a Java project that simulates a blockchain and cryptocurrency system. The project demonstrates key concepts such as users, wallets, transactions, and coin mining, with an interactive twist: finding a hidden cat earns you coins.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore and demonstrate how a blockchain works in practice, including:
- Creating and managing users and wallets.
- Executing transactions between wallets.
- Mining blocks and validating the blockchain.
- Introducing gamification with a hidden reward (the “hidden cat”) to earn coins.

## Features
- Blockchain simulation with basic mining and verification.
- User wallets storing coins and tracking transactions.
- Transaction history between users.
- Gamified interaction: earn coins by finding a hidden cat.
- Demonstrates concepts like immutability, hashing, and ledger management.
